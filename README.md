Tax Dodge Script
=
My name is Tom Chen, I am the former employee of my mom's company ML Resources. Her English isn't too good and we can't afford an outside accountant, so I did the tax returns for her too. Our company's business has always been wholesale purchase of trash from a small handful of factories and recycling yards in the area and shipping over in bulk to China, but China's new Green Fence policies and other import regulations completely gutted our business and we were forced to shut down. A potential client mentioned some time ago he needed a sales tax id, so we got one, but we only sell wholesale and never retail. Based on my research, I am of the understanding we don't owe any sales tax.

I had already been on your website and filled out the forms, but I did it again today for 2013 showing no taxable sales. Our 2013 form 1120 is on extension. We've already wound up and closed down our business and I can send you our government approved state liquidation dissolution forms from the state of California.

We don't have a business phone / email anymore, so you can contact me via my personal email at foxnewsnetwork@gmail.com or you can call my mom (Manping Zhang) at 626 376 6972. Also, please make sure my account is closed.

Oh yeah, I just called you, S RAR 102 212 713

Notes on CSS3 Animation
=
Note the comma placement in the correct animation syntax:
animation: myanime 2s infinite

Placing in commas between is incorrect!
