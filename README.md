Notes on CSS3 Animation
=
Note the comma placement in the correct animation syntax:
animation: myanime 2s infinite

Placing in commas between is incorrect!

Another Personal Site Project
=
This time well designed and implemented in emberjs with rails backend

TODO
=
1. main page animations
2. card page animations
3. card page backgrounds
4. transitions
5. scrap images and data off of github
6. scrolling on card page should bring up a scroll meter that transitions when filled
7. rework the spin-wheel and transitions
8. incorporate three.js and canvas to render really fancy backgrounds
9. ruby rails activerecord models
10. fixed the issue with card 0 instead of being just expo
